	abstract = {The nonresonant tunneling regime for charge transfer across nanojunctions is critically dependent on the so-called β parameter, governing the exponential decay of the current as the length of the junction increases. For periodic materials, this parameter can be theoretically evaluated by computing the complex band structure {(CBS)—or} evanescent states—of the material forming the tunneling junction. In this work we present the calculation of the {CBS} for organic polymers using a variety of computational schemes, including standard local, semilocal, and hybrid-exchange density functionals, and many-body perturbation theory within the {GW} approximation. We compare the description of localization and β parameters among the adopted methods and with experimental data. We show that local and semilocal density functionals systematically underestimate the β parameter, while hybrid-exchange schemes partially correct for this discrepancy, resulting in a much better agreement with {GW} calculations and experiments. Self-consistency effects and self-energy representation issues of the {GW} corrections are discussed together with the use of Wannier functions to interpolate the electronic band structure.},

	abstract = {We describe a complete set of algorithms for ab initio molecular simulations based on numerically tabulated atom-centered orbitals {(NAOs)} to capture a wide range of molecular and materials properties from quantum-mechanical first principles. The full algorithmic framework described here is embodied in the Fritz Haber Institute “ab initio molecular simulations” {(FHI-aims)} computer program package. Its comprehensive description should be relevant to any other first-principles implementation based on {NAOs.} The focus here is on density-functional theory {(DFT)} in the local and semilocal (generalized gradient) approximations, but an extension to hybrid functionals, {Hartree–Fock} theory, and {MP2/GW} electron self-energies for total energies and excited states is possible within the same underlying algorithms. An all-electron/full-potential treatment that is both computationally efficient and accurate is achieved for periodic and cluster geometries on equal footing, including relaxation and ab initio molecular dynamics. We demonstrate the construction of transferable, hierarchical basis sets, allowing the calculation to range from qualitative tight-binding like accuracy to {meV-level} total energy convergence with the basis set. Since all basis functions are strictly localized, the otherwise computationally dominant grid-based operations scale as {O(N)} with system size N. Together with a scalar-relativistic treatment, the basis sets provide access to all elements from light to heavy. Both low-communication parallelization of all real-space grid based algorithms and a {ScaLapack-based}, customized handling of the linear algebra for all matrix operations are possible, guaranteeing efficient scaling {(CPU} time and memory) up to massively parallel computer systems with thousands of {CPUs.}},

	abstract = {Electronic structure calculations are presented for Cu(2-{x)S} using the full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. In the simple cubic antifluorite structure, {Cu(2)S} is found to be semimetallic both in the local density approximation {(LDA)} and using the quasiparticle self-consistent {GW} {(QSGW)} method. This is because the Cu d bands comprising the valence band maximum are degenerate at the Gamma point and the fact that the Cu s band, which can be considered to be the lowest conduction band, lies slightly below it at Gamma. Small deviations from the ideal antifluorite positions for the Cu atoms, however, open a small gap between the Cu d valence and Cu s-like conduction bands because the symmetry breaking allows the Cu s and Cu d bands to hybridize. Supercell models are constructed for cubic and hexagonal chalcocite {Cu(2)S} as well as cubic digenite {Cu(1.8)S} by means of a weighted random number structure generating algorithm. This approach generates models with Wyckoff site occupancies adjusted to those obtained from experimental x-ray diffraction results and with the constraint that atoms should stay within reasonable distance from each other. The band structures of these models as well as of the low-chalcocite monoclinic structure {(Cu(96)S(48))} are calculated in {LDA} with an additional Cu s shift obtained from the {QSGW-LDA} difference for the antifluorite structure. Even with this correction, smaller band gaps of about 0.4-0.6 {eV} (increasing from cubic to hexagonal to monoclinic) than experimentally observed (1.1-1.2 {eV)} are obtained for the {Cu(2)S} composition. Decreasing the Cu content of Cu(2-{x)S} in the range 0.06 {\textless} x {\textless} 0.2 is found to essentially dope the p-type material by placing the Fermi level 0.2-0.3 {eV} below the valence band maximum but also to increase the gap between highest partially filled valence band and lowest conduction bands to about 0.7-1.0 {eV.} This results from a reduced Cu d-band width. Thus, the optical band gap or onset of optical absorption increases in part but not exclusively due to the Moss-Burstein effect. The total energies of the structures are found to increase from monoclinic to hexagonal to cubic to antifluorite. This is consistent with the fact that the simple antifluorite structure is not observed and that the systems change from monoclinic to hexagonal to cubic with increasing temperature, under the assumption that the electronic energy of the system dominates the free energy. We find that {Cu(2)S} is unstable toward the formation of Cu vacancies even in thermodynamic equilibrium with bulk Cu metal. The experimental data on the band gaps and optical absorption are discussed. We find no evidence for indirect band gaps in the hexagonal materials and argue that the experimental results are consistent with this in spite of previous reports to the contrary. The presence of a second onset of absorption located about 0.5 {eV} higher than the minimum band gap observed in experiment is explained by a rise in conduction band density of states at this energy in our calculations. The calculated increase in gap with decreasing Cu concentration is in agreement with experimental observations.},

The band gap is measured by optical methods, and the Cu vacancy density and anion displacement parameter are determined by neutron scattering. Our data show that the band gap decreases for Cu-poor compositions, and the anion displacement is weakly dependent on the concentration of Cu vacancies. This is in apparent contradiction with ab initio calculations that always predict a larger band gap in presence of Cu vacancies. To shed light on this issue, we studied the overall dependence of the band gap on the anion displacement and on the concentration of Cu vacancies using a self-consistent {GW} approach and hybrid functionals, including a feedback mechanism that was recently proposed. Our calculations illustrate consistently the remarkable stability of the band gap of chalcopyrite semiconductors and explain the experimental observations by a coupled effect of Cu vacancies and lattice distortions within the feedback model.},

	abstract = {In a cubic topological insulator {(TI)}, there is a band inversion whereby the s-like Γ6c conduction band is below the p-like Γ7v+Γ8v valence bands by the “inversion energy” Δi{\textless}0. In {TIs} based on the zinc-blende structure such as {HgTe}, the Fermi energy intersects the degenerate Γ8v state so the insulating gap Eg between occupied and unoccupied bands vanishes. To achieve an insulating gap Eg{\textgreater}0 critical for {TI} applications, one often needs to resort to structural manipulations such as structural symmetry lowering (e.g., {Bi2Se3)}, strain, or quantum confinement. However, these methods have thus far opened an insulating gap of only {\textless}0.1 {eV.} Here we point out that there is an electronic rather than structural way to affect an insulating gap in a {TI:} if one can invert the spin-orbit levels and place Γ8v below Γ7v (“negative spin-orbit splitting”), one can realize band inversion (Δi{\textless}0) with a large insulating gap {(Eg} up to 0.5 {eV).} We outline design principles to create negative spin-orbit splitting: hybridization of d orbitals into p-like states. This general principle is illustrated in the “filled tetrahedral structures” {(FTS)} demonstrating via {GW} and density functional theory {(DFT)} calculations Eg{\textgreater}0 with Δi{\textless}0, albeit in a metastable form of {FTS.}},

It enables us to examine approximations behind the standard local density {approximation+U} and self-interaction corrected approaches. {QSGW} reproduces the experimental occupied 4f levels well, though the unoccupied levels are a little overestimated. Properties of the Fermi surface responsible for electronic properties-governed by the spd electrons-are in good agreement with available experimental data. {GdN} is predicted to be very near a critical point of a metal-insulator transition.},

Here we present an approach which we call the quasiparticle self-consistent {GW} approximation. It is based on a kind of self-consistent perturbation theory, where the self-consistency is constructed to minimize the perturbation. We apply it to selections from different classes of materials, including alkali metals, semiconductors, wide band gap insulators, transition metals, transition metal oxides, magnetic insulators, and rare earth compounds. Apart from some mild exceptions, the properties are very well described, particularly in weakly correlated cases. Self-consistency dramatically improves agreement with experiment, and is sometimes essential. Discrepancies with experiment are systematic, and can be explained in terms of approximations made.},

The calculated band gap depends strongly on the anion displacement u, an internal structural parameter that measures lattice distortion. This contrasts with the observed stability of the band gap of {CIS} solar panels under operating conditions, where a relatively large dispersion of values for u occurs. We solve this apparent paradox considering the coupled effect on the band gap of copper vacancies and lattice distortions. The correct treatment of d electrons in these materials requires going beyond density functional theory, and {GW} self-consistency is critical to evaluate the quasiparticle gap and the valence band maximum.},
